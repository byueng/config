# scripts use occasions
- view-figure: I read pdf by "zathura", and always trouble with figures or tables that are far away from the text. And "zathura" can't support some applications can make it. So it is a zathura config scripts.
> what I write in zathurarc(zathura's config file):
`map <C-f> exec /home/username/.config/fish/scripts/view-figure.fish`.
Then can run `Ctrl + f` get the screenshot what needed.
